            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently a fourth-year undergrad at Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA, graduating May 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.
                I'm originally from Seattle, WA. Right now, I am in the process of applying to PhD programs in computer science and software engineering to further my research in 
                software quality.

                <h3>Efficient Bug Finding in Robotic Deep Learning: Adversarial Rendering for GQCNNs</h3>
                <p><strong>Ongoing Project!</strong></p>
                <p>I am currently working on my Honor's Thesis at Dickinson College, advised by Professor John MacCormick from Dickinson College and Professor
                    Claire Le Goues from CMU. The project is an extension of an REU project from CMU's REUSE during 2023. We are combining the strategies of differentiable rendering 
                    and adverarial attacks to develop a new testing methodology for a type of CNNs called Grasp Quality Convolutional Neural Networks (GQCNNs). Our goal is to find 
                    perturbed 3D objects for which the GQCNN model incorrectly predicts the feasibility of a particular grasp.

                <h3>MELT: Mining Effective Lightweight Transformations from Pull Requests</h3>
                <p>I started working on this as an REU project at REUSE at CMU in 2022 advised by Professor Claire Le Goues, and continued working on the project until publication.</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>Software developers often struggle to update APIs, leading to manual, time-consuming, and error-prone processes. We introduce Melt, 
                    a new approach that generates lightweight API migration rules directly from pull requests in popular library repositories. Our key insight is that pull requests 
                    merged into open-source libraries are a rich source of information sufficient to mine API migration rules. By leveraging code examples mined from the library 
                    source and automatically generated code examples based on the pull requests, we infer transformation rules in Comby, a language for structural code search and 
                    replace. Since inferred rules from single code examples may be too specific, we propose a generalization procedure to make the rules more applicable to client 
                    projects. Melt rules are syntax-driven, interpretable, and easily adaptable. Moreover, unlike previous work, our approach enables rule inference to seamlessly 
                    integrate into the library workflow, removing the need to wait for client code migrations. We evaluated Melt on pull requests from four popular libraries, 
                    successfully mining 461 migration rules from code examples in pull requests and 114 rules from auto-generated code examples. Our generalization procedure 
                    increases the number of matches for mined rules by 9Ã—. We applied these rules to client projects and ran their tests, which led to an overall decrease in the 
                    number of warnings and fixing some test cases demonstrating MELT's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.</p>
